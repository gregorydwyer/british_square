# British Square
British Square is a simple strategy board game, written with AppGameKit.

Developed as an introductory project to coding, I wrote this over a long summer. It's not pretty or well commented, but it functions and got me into the world of coding.
As I get ready to graduate with a degree in Computer Science, I wanted to share where I started. Feel free to poke around and take a look. If you want to try the game, 
it is available on the Google Play Store or in your browser [here](https://gregorydwyer.github.io/HTML5/British_Squares.html).
